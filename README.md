# Fits_header_to_csv
A simple python code for outputing lines in fits header to a csv (keywords, values, and comments)

Because it seems there is no library which outputs lines in fits header to a csv, I prepared this.
The python code is definitrly unefficient one.
So please someone polish this, I hope.

usage:

try
python fits_header_to_csv.py

and then

python csv_to_fits_header.py
