# Fits_header_to_csv
A simple python code for converting fits header to a csv file (keywords, values, and comments)

Because it seems there is no library which outputs lines in fits header to a csv, I prepared this.
Note: The python code is definitrly unefficient one. Need modification.

===  
usage:  


try  
python fits_header_to_csv.py  

and then  
python csv_to_fits_header.py
