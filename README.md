# Fits_header_to_csv
Simple python codes for converting fits header to a csv file (keywords, values, and comments), and vice versa.

Because it seems there is no library which outputs lines in fits header to a csv file, I prepared this.
Note: The python codes are definitrly unefficient ones. Need modification.

===  
usage:  


try  
python fits_header_to_csv.py  

and then  
python csv_to_fits_header.py
